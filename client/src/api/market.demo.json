Additionally the checkbox \"Override inform host with controller hostname/IP\" has to be checked, so that devices can connect to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption).",

Piped offers a host of user-centric features, including an ad-free experience, no tracking, a lightweight design that places minimal load on both servers and clients, infinite scrolling for seamless content discovery, and the flexibility to switch between light and dark themes. It also provides login functionality, customizable feeds, integration with SponsorBlock and LBRY for streaming, 4K video support, and bypassing geo-restrictions where possible through a federated network.</p><p>From a technical perspective, Piped incorporates multi-region load-balancing and is designed to handle thousands of users concurrently. Notably, it achieves these features without relying on official YouTube APIs, instead using NewPipeExtractor to extract information and offering a public JSON API. Furthermore, Piped operates on a federated protocol on Matrix, enabling instances to collaborate with each other.</p><p>The platform is actively developed, translated into multiple languages, and is hosted on various mirror sites for redundancy and availability.
